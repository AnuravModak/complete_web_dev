VIEWS:

1) For all the routes like /login,/register you need to have layouts with respective names
like i have done in "VIEWS"
2) Comments doesnot work in ejs.
3)"<p class="lead mb-3">Welcome <%= user.name %></p>" this is how i am gonna access user's name by creating a user object.

register"
1) value="<%= typeof name != 'undefined' ? name : '' %>"...now this will make sure that while registering u do something wrong and submits the form....ur filled fields wont get empty...that is u dont need to fill those fields again....



ROUTES:
1)users
    a) const {name,email,password,password2}=req.body;
    this is how you pull out all the data form req.body just use ===> const { }=req.body; and variables according to ur need.
    b) Now i am not usin express-generator....here in my app.js i dont have error handler....either you can add it and work according to it
    or you can use express.generator to do the same...and how to send errors......refer
    b) after logging out you may again go to same page without logging in...so for that u will use auth.js in config file 






PARTIALS:
it is a piece of markup...or HTML
"<%= " this tag will help u to directly put information from object in web page


PASSPORT:
now to authenticate a user, we will require password entered by user and hashed password stored in database............
we will use bcryptjs.compare(password,user.password,callback(err,boolean))......if matched boolean will have true else false......
